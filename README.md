# Why I love building and using and configuring a NAS for my home network
###### By: Noah Nemec

Since the summer I have started working on building and maintaining a NAS, I primarily wanted to use the NAS to host a Plex server as well as be a backup for my laptop and my data that was on external drives in cold storage until I needed to dump files off of my laptop.

#### These are the steps I took to create the NAS I now have.
1. [Find a pc](/findpc.md)
2. [Find an OS to use](/os.md)
3. [Shuck external drives to be able to connect via SATA](drive.md)
4. [Put all hardware together with PC and HD](/hardware.md)
5. [Configure OS with shares, Plex and Transmission](configure.md)
6. Enjoy the awesomeness of having a NAS
